# LibManSys
RCive++ Project Repository for CPE104L Module 2

## Description:
The LibManSys or Library eTracker project is a Library Management System developed using C++ and [Qt](https://www.qt.io/). Key features of the program include the ability to perform CRUD operations, Searching and Sorting, a working GUI, a ticketing system for book borrowing, and a way to manage these tickets automatically. The project is being worked on and developed by RCive++, a group of 3 beginner programmers.

## Notice:
The password to enter admin mode is "***password*** ".

The text file generated by the program is named **bookRepository.txt** and can be found in the **build-LibManSys-Desktop_x86_windows_msys_pe_64bit-Debug** folder. This folder is usually generated in the same folder as the main files of the program which can be found in the folder named **LibManSys**.

The text file also makes use of vertical lines ("|") to separate data. When adding a book to the repository, do not use this character as it will make the program create a new column. In the event that this occurs, navigate to the **bookRepository.txt** file and clear out its contents. Refer to the above paragraph to find the file.

In the case of the programmers, the directories are:

D:\QT Projects\LibManSys

D:\QT Projects\build-LibManSys-Desktop_x86_windows_msys_pe_64bit-Debug
